# Creating a High Available, Fault Tolerant and Secure AWS 3-Tier Web Architecture
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a scalable and highly available, fault tolerant three-tier architecture on AWS. The architecture consists of a web tier, application tier, and database tier, enabling the deployment of a web application with efficient resource utilization.

## Architecture Overview
The three-tier architecture is designed to separate the presentation layer (web tier), application logic layer (application tier), and data storage layer (database tier). This separation allows for modular development, scalability, and flexibility.
